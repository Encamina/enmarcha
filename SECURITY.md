## Security

ENCAMINA takes the security of our software products and services seriously.

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any ENCAMINA-owned repository that meets the [MITRE](https://www.mitre.org/) definition of a security vulnerability, which defines a security vulnerability as *“a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, OR availability. Mitigation of the vulnerabilities in this context typically involves coding changes but could also include specification changes or even specification deprecations (e.g., removal of affected protocols or functionality in their entirety).”* (MITRE.org CNA Rules  7.1), then please report it to us as described below.

## Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public channels.**

Instead, please send an email to the owners of the library incluiding the following information listed below (as much as you can provide), to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

  * Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.).
  * Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue.
  * The location of the affected source code (site, tag, branch, commit or direct URL).
  * Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue.
  * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue.
  * Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible).
  * Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue.

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

## Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in Spanish or English.
